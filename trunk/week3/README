For each exercise:
1. Try to understand the source code
2. Correct it (if needed)
3. Compile the code and run the program

Tricks:
- You can compile on your Host "Ubuntu" system
- You can use the classical text edito to read and modify the code

Attention, these are new exercices:
- Some examples may be too difficult
- Some variable names and comments are still in french

If it doesn't work, don't lose too much time on an exercise, and give
us your feedback!
